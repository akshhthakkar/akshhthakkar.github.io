    <h1>Hello! I’m Aksh Thakkar</h1>
    <h3>Second-year B.Tech. CSE @ Parul University (Class of 2027)</h3>

      I’m super passionate about tech, especially building clean and user-friendly websites with HTML and JavaScript. I love crafting web pages that not only work smoothly but also look dope. Always grinding to level up my web dev game.

      Lately, AI’s been catching my eye — it’s crazy how it can solve real-world problems. I’m just starting to dip my toes into AI, and so far, projects like my personal portfolio website have helped me sharpen my coding and design skills. Can’t wait to dive deeper and create more practical AI-powered stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m all about learning, collaborating, and bringing fresh ideas to life. Whether it’s internships, hackathons, or team projects, I’m hyped to contribute, soak up knowledge, and grow as a web developer and AI explorer.
