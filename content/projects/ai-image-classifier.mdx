The AI Image Classifier is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to upload images and instantly classify them using a pre-trained deep learning model.

This project was built to explore practical AI usage—taking a powerful model and wrapping it in a clean, accessible interface that anyone can use without ML knowledge.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to understand how pre-trained AI models can be:

- Integrated into real applications
- Used without training from scratch
- Presented through a clean, user-friendly interface

Instead of focusing on model training, this project emphasizes application-level AI integration, which is how AI is often used in real-world products.

## What the App Does

1. Users upload an image (JPG, JPEG, or PNG)
2. The image is processed and passed to a deep learning model
3. The app returns the top 3 predictions along with confidence scores
4. Results are displayed instantly in a clean UI

The experience is designed to be fast, simple, and intuitive.

## Core Features

### Image Upload & Classification

- Supports common image formats
- Instant inference after upload

### Pre-trained AI Model

- Uses MobileNetV2, trained on ImageNet
- Lightweight and efficient for fast predictions
- No custom training required

### Top Predictions

- Displays the top 3 predicted classes
- Shows confidence percentages for transparency

### Clean & Interactive UI

- Built with Streamlit
- Minimal layout focused on usability

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core language
- **Streamlit** – Web interface
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning framework
- **MobileNetV2** – Pre-trained image classification model

## How It Works (High Level)

1. User uploads an image
2. Image is resized and preprocessed
3. MobileNetV2 performs inference
4. Predictions are decoded and ranked
5. Top 3 results are displayed with confidence scores

This mirrors how many production AI features work behind the scenes.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a clearer understanding of:

- Using pre-trained deep learning models effectively
- Image preprocessing for inference
- Deploying AI functionality through simple web apps
- Making AI outputs understandable for non-technical users

It reinforced the idea that AI is most valuable when it's accessible.

## Project Status

The application is complete and functional. Possible future improvements include:

- Support for camera input
- Batch image classification
- Model comparison or confidence visualization
