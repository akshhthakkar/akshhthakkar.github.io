The ERP System is a full-stack ERP platform designed to help small and medium businesses manage inventory, process sales, and gain business insights through analytics. The goal of this project was to build a robust, backend-driven system that mirrors how real ERP software behaves in production.

## Why I Built This

Most academic projects stop at CRUD operations. This project goes further.

I wanted to understand how real business systems:

- Maintain data integrity during sales
- Track profit and cost accurately
- Handle edge cases like dead stock and zero sales
- Automate workflows like billing, notifications, and reports

This ERP system was built to simulate real operational challenges, not just display data.

## Core Features

### Authentication & Security

- JWT-based authentication for login and registration
- Google OAuth support for simplified onboarding
- Protected routes and middleware-based access control

### Inventory Management

- Add, edit, and delete products with image uploads
- Cost price (CP) and selling price tracking
- Minimum stock thresholds for alerts
- System-defined and custom user categories

### Sales & Billing

- Stock validation before every sale
- Automatic inventory deduction using atomic transactions
- PDF bill generation for every sale
- Bills uploaded to cloud storage and emailed to customers

### Analytics & Reports

- Monthly sales reports
- Top-selling products
- Dead stock detection
- Profit summary based on cost vs revenue

### Smart Notifications & Supply Chain

- Low stock alerts
- Forecast-based restock suggestions
- Deduplicated notifications to avoid spam
- Cron-based background jobs for scheduled tasks

## System Design Highlights

This project focuses heavily on robust backend design:

- Atomic sales transactions ensure inventory accuracy
- Edge-case handling for zero sales, dead stock, and partial failures
- Decoupled architecture using controllers, services, and utilities
- Audit and restock logs for traceability

The system is designed to behave predictably even under incorrect or unexpected input.

## Application Flow Overview

### Authentication Flow

Users authenticate via JWT or Google OAuth, after which all routes are protected using middleware.

### Inventory Flow

Products are created with pricing and category metadata, images are uploaded to cloud storage, and inventory is persisted in MongoDB.

### Sales Flow

Sales validate available stock → deduct inventory → create sales records → generate PDF bills → upload bills → email customers → trigger alerts if required.

### Profit Calculation

Profit is calculated dynamically based on cost price and selling price across all sales.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT Authentication
- Cloudinary (image & PDF storage)
- Nodemailer (email delivery)
- PDFKit (bill generation)

### Frontend

- React
- Vite
- Redux for state management

## What I Learned

This project significantly improved my understanding of:

- Backend-first system design
- Data consistency and transactional safety
- Real-world business workflows
- Scalable API structuring
- Cloud-based file handling and email automation

It also taught me how small design decisions impact system reliability.

## Deployment Considerations

The application is structured for production deployment with:

- Environment-based configuration
- Cloud-ready asset storage
- Secure credential handling
- Configurable CORS and API base URLs

## Project Status

The system is functionally complete and stable. Future improvements include:

- Role-based access control
- Advanced forecasting models
- Improved UI analytics dashboards
